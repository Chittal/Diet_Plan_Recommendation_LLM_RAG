It is a practical overview for health care practitioners working in diabetes management. The chapter is divided into sections by content and includes sources for further reading. A primary message is that nutrition plans should meet the specific needs of the patient and take into consideration their ability to implement change. Often starting with small achievable changes is best, with larger changes discussed as rapport builds. Referral to medical nutrition therapy (MNT) provided by a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and a diabetes self- management education and support (DSMES) program is highlighted.  INTRODUCTION  This chapter will summarize current information available from a variety of evidence-based guidelines and resources on dietary advice for those with diabetes. The modern diet for those with diabetes is based on concepts from clinical research, portion control, and individualized lifestyle change. It requires open and honest communication between health care practitioner and patient and cannot be delivered by giving a person a diet sheet in a one-size-fits- all approach. The lifestyle modification guidance and support needed most often requires a team effort, ideally including a registered dietitian (RD) or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN), or a referral to a diabetes self- management education and support (DSMES) program that includes dietary advice. Current (2024) recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) promote all health care professionals to refer people with diabetes for individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) provided by an RDN at diagnosis and as needed throughout the life span, in addition to DSMES (1). It is very important to note that dietary recommendations for those with diabetes are virtually the same recommendations for diabetes prevention and the health of the general population; however, it cannot be excluded that people with diabetes will require additional support to meet the recommendations.  Fang et al, reported that although there has been continued improvements in risk factor control and adherence to preventative practices over the past decades, half of U.S. adults with diabetes do not meet the recommended goals for diabetes care in 2015-2018 (2). This is a current and ongoing issue. Diet and lifestyle recommendations are cornerstones of advice to prevent and manage diabetes, however there are recognized barriers to heeding advice and implementing lifestyle change. First, there is a plethora of dietary information for diabetes management available from many sources, although not all is evidence-based or current. There are also social, cultural, and personal preferences unique to each individual that must be taken into consideration when making long-term dietary change. Many health care "

For more information see: https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/weight-watchers-diet  Individualized Menus Provided by a RD/RDN  Many people with diabetes might like to have examples to follow when setting up meal plans. The menu describes in writing what foods and what quantities should be consumed over a period of days. A dietitian creates an individualized menu based on the specific nutritional counseling plan and incorporates the client\u2019s unique preferences, schedule, etc. The client then has written examples to follow, and over time may learn how to independently create their own menus and substitutions to fit their individual lifestyle.  Month of Meals  These menus were created by committees of the Council on Nutritional Science and Metabolism of the American Diabetes Association, and staff of the American Diabetes Association National Service Center in response to frequent requests for menus from people with diabetes and their families. The menus are designed to follow the exchange groups and provide 45-50% of energy from CHO, 20% protein, and about 30% fat. The menus provide 1200 or 1800 calories, and instructions are provided on how to adjust caloric levels upward or downward. Each menu provides 28 days of breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks with a different focus to help make planning meals easier.   Exchange List Approach  The Exchange Lists for Meal Planning were developed by the American Diabetes Association and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, and have been in existence since 1950. The latest version of Choose Your Foods: Food Lists for Diabetes was released in 2019. The concept for this list is that foods are grouped according to similar nutritional value, and can be exchanged or substituted in the portion size listed within the same group. The exchange lists include:  \u2022 Carbohydrate group \u2013 includes starches, fruit, milk and vegetable. \u2022 Meat and Meat Substitutes group \u2013 four meat categories based on the amount of fat they contain. \u2022 Fat group \u2013 contains three categories of fats based on the major source of fat contained: saturated, polyunsaturated or monounsaturated.  The exchange lists also give information on fiber and sodium content. They can be utilized for people with type 1 or 2 diabetes. The emphasis for type 1 is on consistency of timing and amount of food eaten, while for type 2, the focus is on controlling the caloric values of food consumed. Use of the exchange list may be helpful for some people while others may benefit by learning from other carbohydrate counting resources available online and through numerous publications and resources.  Calorie Counting   These are meal planning methods that can be useful for people with type 2 diabetes who want to lose weight. Knowledge regarding the number of total calories in a given food (including pre-prepared and fast foods) and becoming adept at label reading, can help promote weight loss when incorporated into other lifestyle changes. One of the first studies designed to determine empirically if people can learn a calorie counting system and if estimated food intake improves with training demonstrated that use of the Health Management Resources Calorie System tool (HMRe, Boston, MA, USA) helped to teach people how to estimate food intake more accurately (77).

Dietary Advice Should Start Gradually   \u2022 Emphasis should initially be on establishing supportive rapport with the child and family with simple instructions. More detailed guidelines should be administered later by the entire team, with focus on consistency in message, and should include dietary guidelines to avoid hypoglycemia. Instruction on carbohydrate counting should be provided as soon as possible after diagnosis (52). \u2022 Nutritional advice needs to be given to all caregivers; babysitters, and extended family who care for the child. \u2022 Nutrition guidelines should be based on dietary history of the family and child\u2019s meal pattern and habits prior to the diagnosis of diabetes and focus on nutritional recommendations for reducing risk of associated complications and cardiovascular risk that are applicable to the entire family. \u2022 Physical activity schedules need to be assessed, along with 24-hour recall, and 3-day food diary to determine energy intake. Growth patterns and weight gain need to be assessed every 3-6 months and recommended dietary advice adjusted accordingly (51).  Dietary recommendations can be illustrated by use of the Plate method. There are numerous resources for visuals and educational materials using the plate method and some are specific to diabetes. Half the plate should consist of vegetables and fruit, while the other half is divided between whole grains and lean sources of protein. The dairy is represented by a glass of nonfat or 1% milk or other nonfat or low-fat dairy source.

While fast weight loss is a highly desirable outcome, the ultimate health benefits from weight management are likely to depend on long-term weight loss maintenance (10). Long-term low-intensity structured programs, including support for changing food choice, eating pattern and physical activity, and psychological support for behavior change, can help to sustain new behaviors, relationships with foods and adherence to dietary advice, and thus improve weight-loss maintenance (68, 69). Given that dietary adherence can be socially and psychologically testing, skills and empathy from the health professional is needed, providing consistent, long-term, evidence-based support (70). Discussions with patients around weight loss should be entered into with their permission (71) and are important, given the prevalence of obesity (72) and its connection to diabetes incidence (18).

There are also commercial determinants of health that influence dietary intakes, such as marketing advertising, and price discounting on certain foods. The following recommendations come from evidence-based guideline development processes and emphasize practical suggestions for implementing dietary advice for most individuals with diabetes.  GENERAL GOALS  Dietary advice for those with diabetes has evolved and have become more flexible and patient centered over time. Nutrition goals from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2024 include the following: (1)  1. To promote and support healthful eating patterns, emphasizing a variety of nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes, to improve overall health and:  \u2022 achieve and maintain body weight goals. \u2022 attain individualized glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid goals. \u2022 delay or prevent the complications of diabetes. 2. To address individual nutrition needs based on personal and cultural preferences, health literacy and numeracy, access to healthful foods, willingness and ability to make behavioral changes, and existing barriers to change. 3. To maintain the pleasure of eating by providing nonjudgmental messages about food choices while limiting food choices only when indicated by scientific evidence. 4. To provide an individual with diabetes the practical tools for developing healthy eating patterns rather than focusing on individual macronutrients, micronutrients, or single foods. \u2022  \u2022 The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) guidelines have similar nutrition goals for people with type 2 diabetes (3).  PUTTING GOALS INTO PRACTICE  How should these goals best be put into practice? The following guidelines summarized from the ADA Standards of Care will address the above goals and provide guidance on nutrition therapy based on numerous scientific resources. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and other studies demonstrated the added value individualized consultation with a registered dietitian familiar with diabetes treatments, along with regular follow-up, has on long-term outcomes and is highly recommended to aid in lifestyle compliance (4). Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) implemented by a registered dietitian is associated with A1C reductions of 1.0\u20131.9% for people with type 1 diabetes and 0.3\u20132.0% for people with type 2 diabetes (1).  TARGET GUIDELINES FOR MACRONUTRIENTS: THE 3 MAJOR COMPONENTS OF DIET  Many studies have been completed to attempt to determine the optimal combination of macronutrients. Based on available data, the best mix of carbohydrate, protein, and fat depends on the individual metabolic goals and preferences of the person with diabetes. It\u2019s most important to ensure that total energy intake is kept in mind for weight loss or maintenance (1).  CARBOHYDRATES  The primary goal in the management of diabetes is to achieve as near normal regulation of blood glucose as possible. Both the type and total amount of carbohydrate (CHO) consumed influences glycemia. Carbohydrate intake should emphasize nutrient-dense carbohydrate sources that are high in fiber (at least 14 g fiber per 1,000 kcal) and minimally "

This list replaces easily misplaced or damaged paper lists. When planning the meal, a wipe-off marker is used to write down the number of servings for each food category, as indicated on the plan. Then circle or tally the food choices in each category to track progress toward the plan\u2019s targets. Carbohydrate categories - starch and bread, fruit, milk and other carbohydrates - which affect blood glucose and which can be exchanged for each other, are color coded in yellow for easy identification and proper selection. Other food categories - vegetables, meat, fat and free foods - are individually color-coded.  The other side of the Diabetes Place Mat illustrates the \"Plate Method\" of managing a diet for proper nutrition and control of blood glucose and weight. It shows the proportions of each food category that are appropriate for a healthy, balanced diet. The food groups shown on the top half of the Plate Method side are carbohydrates, which affect blood glucose the most - fruit, milk, and starch & bread. These are colored in yellow to distinguish them from the other food groups that don't significantly affect blood glucose (meat, vegetables, fat and free foods). The food categories are shown in proportion to how much of each might be eaten in a healthy, balanced diet. The plate method is a great plan for those who have poor math or reading skills or are non- English speaking.  Mediterranean-Style Eating  The Mediterranean-style eating pattern derived from the Mediterranean region of the world has been observed to improve glycemic control and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The Mediterranean eating pattern includes:   \u2022 Vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, potatoes, whole grains, breads, herbs, spices, fish, seafood and extra virgin olive oil. Emphasis is placed on use of minimally processed foods, seasonal fresh and locally grown foods. \u2022 Olive oil is the primary fat, replacing other fats and oils (including butter and margarine). \u2022 Fresh fruit as daily dessert; sweets only rarely. \u2022 Low-to-moderate amounts of cheese and yogurt. \u2022 Red meat limited to only 12 oz to 16 oz per month.  DASH Eating Plan  Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is a flexible and balanced eating plan that is based on research studies sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The DASH diet emphasizes vegetables, fruit, fat-free or low-fat dairy, whole grains, nuts and legumes, and limit the intake of total and saturated fat, cholesterol, red and processed meats, sweets and added sugars, including sugar-sweetened beverages. Results from RCTs indicate reductions in glycemia, blood pressure, body weight, and -cholesterol concentrations (73). In prospective cohort studies the DASH diet is associated with reductions in the risk of CVD, CHD and stroke (73). DASH is considerably lower in sodium than the typical American diet.   Intermittent Fasting  The popularity of intermittent fasting has increased recently as a new way to lose weight and possibly lead to better control of Type 2 diabetes. There are many suggested types of intermittent fasts; some involve eating only on specific days, or not eating for a specified number of hours, alternated by day or hours in which food consumption is allowed. Others greatly restrict energy intake on some days but allow a more normalized diet on other days. There is no one specific intermittent fasting diet that has been proven to be beneficial. Since energy intake is restricted for certain periods of time, an individual with diabetes may lose weight over time if they maintain an overall energy deficit in relation to energy expenditure as is seen with any successful weight loss method.

Higher intakes of sugars are associated with weight gain and greater incidence of dental caries (5). Conversely, higher intakes of dietary fiber are associated with reduced non-communicable disease and premature mortality occurrence as well as improvements in body weight, cholesterol concentrations, and blood pressure (6, 7). These benefits with higher fiber intakes have been observed in the general population, for those with type 1, type 2, and pre diabetes, (8) and those with hypertension or heart disease (9). With this guidance in mind, eating plans should emphasize non-starchy vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains, as well as dairy products with minimal added sugars (1, 10). There is less consistency of evidence for recommending an amount of overall CHO in the diet (1). This is in line with current World Health Organization for carbohydrate intakes for adults and children which stress the type of carbohydrate is important, with recommendations for fiber and vegetable and fruit intake, but no recommendations on CHO amount (7). Recent dietary guidelines for diabetes management from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes stress that a wide range of carbohydrate intakes can be appropriate, however both very high (>70%Total Energy (TE)) and low (<40%TE) intakes are associated with premature mortality (10). A recent comprehensive Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with overweight or obesity with or without type 2 diabetes concluded that there is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow-up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomized to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets (11). Some of the reasons for these findings of a lack of effect with lower carbohydrate diets may be that: interventions do not consider the type of carbohydrate being consumed, with dietary fiber and sugar having differing physiological effects; the differing definitions of low CHO diets being applied; what CHO is replaced with; and that diets lower in CHO maybe difficult to maintain in the long term as they are not consistent with the socio, cultural, and personal preference of many. Current ADA recommendations relating to CHO are: (1)   \u2022 Emphasize minimally processed, nutrient-dense, high-fiber sources of carbohydrate (at least 14 g fiber per 1,000 kcal). \u2022 People with diabetes and those at risk are advised to replace sugar-sweetened beverages (including fruit juices) with water or low-calorie or no-calorie beverages as much as possible to manage glycemia and reduce risk for cardiometabolic disease and minimize consumption of foods with added sugar that have the capacity to displace healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices.  \u2022 Provide education on the glycemic impact of carbohydrate, fat, and protein tailored to an individual\u2019s needs, insulin plan, and preferences to optimize mealtime insulin dosing.  \u2022 When using fixed insulin doses, individuals should be provided with education about consistent patterns of carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount while considering the insulin action time, as it can result in improved glycemia and reduce the risk for hypoglycemia.  Dietary Fiber  Current recommendations from the American Diabetes Association are that adults with diabetes should consume high fiber foods (at least 14g fiber per 1,000 kcal) (1). Current recommendations from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes are that adults with diabetes should consume at least 35g dietary fiber per day (or 16.7g per 1,000 kcal) (10). These two values are aligned, and higher than current World Health Organization recommendations for the general population of at least 25g dietary fiber per day, (7) although all three recommendations recognize a minimum intake level, with greater benefits observed with higher intakes. These values are appreciably higher than current dietary fiber intakes in the United States, which is approximately 16g per day. Our understanding of the importance of dietary fiber has "

If it is still too low, another serving is advised. Repeat these steps until blood glucose is at least 70 mg/dL. Then, a snack should be consumed if it will be an hour or more before the next meal.   Those who take insulin or a sulfonylurea should be advised to always carry one of the quick-fix foods with them, when driving, and also have available nearby when sleeping. Wearing a medical ID bracelet or necklace is also a good idea, as is having a glucagon emergency kit or nasal spray on hand and knowing how to administer, as well as training close contacts to administer as well.  WEIGHT LOSS FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO LOSE WEIGHT  While the general principles discussed so far apply to all people with diabetes, those with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese (BMI >25 kg/m2 or >23 kg/m2 for Asians) and wish to lose weight can require greater support to do so. Consistent evidence has indicated that intentional weight loss reduces blood glucose in people with type 2 diabetes, and improves most other major cardiometabolic risk factors (58, 59). Clinical guidelines state that weight loss through nutrition and physical activity are fundamental to type 2 diabetes management (60, 61). However, with so many weight loss \u201cdiets\u201d available, confusion abounds and reinforces the absolute importance that health professionals provide consistent, evidence-based advice. It is also important to have realistic expectations about the speed at which weight is lost. Obesity does not occur overnight, and its treatment requires long term adjustments to energy intake and expenditure.   Many randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of trials have been undertaken and to ascertain which macronutrient combination leads to greater weight loss. A two-year head- to-head trial comparing four weight loss diets with differing macronutrient content concluded that all four reduced energy diets, regardless of macronutrient content, led to comparable modest weight loss with weight regain over time (62). This finding was reinforced by a recent comprehensive Cochrane systematic review of RCTs of adults with overweight or obesity with or without type 2 diabetes (11). This review concluded that there is probably little to no difference in weight reduction and changes in cardiovascular risk factors up to two years' follow-up, when overweight and obese participants without and with T2DM are randomized to either low-carbohydrate or balanced-carbohydrate weight-reducing diets. The understanding that focusing on reducing energy intake overall, rather than through a specific macronutrient, frees up weight loss advice so that it can be tailored to the individual\u2019s personal, cultural, and social norms. In this context, understanding reasons for eating, portion size, the energy density of different foods, and factors that promote satiety such as high fiber intakes become essential for achieving and maintaining weight loss.  The most important variable in selecting a weight loss plan is the ability of the individual to follow it over the long term. Developing an individualized weight loss program together, preferably with a registered dietitian nutritionist familiar with diabetes management, along with regular follow-ups, will help promote and maintain weight loss. Initial physical activity recommendations alongside dietary changes should be moderate, gradually increasing the duration and frequency to at least 30 minutes a day of activities such as walking.   Current evidence indicates that \u2018low\u2019, and \u2018very low\u2019 energy diets using total or partial diet replacement formula diet products are highly effective for weight loss and reduction of other cardiometabolic risk factors when compared with food-based weight-loss diets (63-65). Furthermore, low-energy nutritionally complete formula diets with a \u2018total diet replacement\u2019 induction phase are the most effective dietary approach for achieving type 2 diabetes remission (65-67). Comparing \u2018low\u2019 with \u2018very-low\u2019 energy diets, many people find very-low-energy diets (420\u2013550 kcal/day) difficult to sustain, and they do not generate "
